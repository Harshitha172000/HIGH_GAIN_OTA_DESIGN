# HIGH_GAIN_OTA_DESIGN
An Operational Transconductance Amplifier is to be implemented which typically provides a very high gain. We have discussed different OTA topologies from simple differential amplifiers to Folded cascode theoretically, along with simulation results. All simulations are done in LTSPICE. Differences between all these topologies are observed in terms of gain, swing limits and other specific parameters.
